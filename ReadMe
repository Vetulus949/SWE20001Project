# SWE20001 Project
## Setup
First ensure that you have Node.JS installed on your system, from [their website here](https://nodejs.org/en)
### Setting up mySql server
To use the server there also needs to be a local instance of mySQL running.
To set up the database run the *schema.sql* file either through the mysql terminal or your prefered interface.
### Running the Server
Either navigate to the App directory in the terminal and execute the Node.JS command *npm start* to start the server.
Or run the *startServer.bat* file also in the app directory.
Once the terminal echos "Running at Port 3000" the server is running. To close the server simply close the terminal.
To access the web app go to "localhost:3000" on your prefered internet browser.
## Trouble Shooting
If the terminal does not echo "Running at port 3000", the server has not starting.
If you are using the startServer bat file the terminal the terminal will also close instead of showing the error; to see the error run *npm start* from the app directory in another terminal.
The most likely cause of the error is due to issues with creating the connection to your local mySQL server.
To fix this in App.JS ensure that the variable "con" matches your local server and connects to the correct database.
Additionally if your mySQL server is not running on the default mySQL ports you may need to add the line `port: [Your established mysql port]`
